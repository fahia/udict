# udict
Urban Dictionary from your command line.

# Usage
`udict define -word=word-you-want-defined`

# Installing

This is still a WIP, I'd like to add more dictionary support. For now, you'll have to pull the repo and build the package yourself.
I'll be providing an easier way to pull a compiled package and install it with ease..soon.
